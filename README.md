PP-215 is a beautiful flip clock timer used to power electronics (eg. audio equipment) at the same time.

The international model JT-215 can be found from Ebay for around $200 but this Japan model is much cheaper at around $60 but only works on 100v outlet.

In this project I will convert the Japan model to work on 230v outlets using Arduino Nano and a 28BYJ48 stepper motor.
